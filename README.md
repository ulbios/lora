# LoRa Projects
This repository contains a series of projects making use of the LoRa modulation
technology. LoRa allows us to wirelessly cover long distances in complicated
scenarios where wired installations are not a viable option.

Each directory contains a self-contained project we have made use of at some point
or other. A `README.md` file on each directory's root explains what the project
tries to accomplish whilst offering any necessary additional information.
